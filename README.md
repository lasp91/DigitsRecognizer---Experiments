# DigitsRecognizer---Experiments
Original code is from the book "Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers" by Mathias Brandewinder

Taking a look at code from the referred book, I decided to experiment with the original code and also use different languages for comparison purposes, but getting the same results.
I basically created a new “C++” code project based on the existing “C#” code.
For the “Functional C++” project I tried to use “types” and “lambdas” to convey the functional approach.
There’s also an F# project that can be compiled.
Running the code is also possible to compare the execution time between the different projects.

There’s also another repo with Kotlin code, where it’s possible to compare the code with the ones here in this repo.

--- I used the “CsvParser_2016_03_28.zip” on the C++ code. The file can be found here:
